# Agent Memory

> [!NOTE]
> This file stores persistent learnings and preferences discovered during development. AI agents should update this file when discovering important patterns or user preferences.

## User Preferences

### Code Style Preferences
- [e.g., Prefers functional components over class components]
- [e.g., Prefers explicit error handling over try-catch blocks]

### Communication Preferences
- [e.g., Prefers detailed explanations for complex changes]
- [e.g., Likes concise commit messages]

## Learned Patterns

### Common Solutions
| Problem | Solution | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| [e.g., CORS issues in development] | [e.g., Use proxy configuration in Vite] | [Additional context] |

### Project-Specific Patterns
- [e.g., All API endpoints follow REST conventions]
- [e.g., State updates should use immutable patterns]

## Recurring Issues

### Known Gotchas
- [e.g., Remember to run migrations after pulling]
- [e.g., Environment variables need .env.local for local dev]

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- [e.g., Don't import from barrel files in tests - causes circular dependencies]

## Important Discoveries

### Performance
- [e.g., Lazy loading routes improved initial bundle by 40%]

### Security
- [e.g., All user inputs sanitized through sanitize-html library]

## Session History

### Recent Major Changes
| Date | Change | Impact |
|------|--------|--------|
| [YYYY-MM-DD] | [Description] | [Impact on codebase] |
